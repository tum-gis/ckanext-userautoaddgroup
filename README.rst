===================
ckanext-userautoaddgroup
===================

CKAN plugin to add new users to top(parent) groups automatically.

This plugin implements the ``user_create`` action to add users to an existing
parent group with a given role (both specified in the configuration - See Config
Settings below).

This code is adjusted from:
´´https://github.com/aptivate/ckanext-userautoadd´´

------------
Requirements
------------

Tested with CKAN v2.9

------------
Installation
------------


To install ckanext-userautoadd:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example::

     . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

2. Install the ckanext-userautoadd Python package into your virtual environment::

     pip install ckanext-userautoaddgroup

3. Add ``userautoaddgroup`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``).

4. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu::

     sudo service apache2 reload

Config Settings

::

    # The organization to which new users are added
    ckan.userautoaddgroup.group_name_1 = [name1]
    ckan.userautoaddgroup.group_name_2 = [name2]
    ckan.userautoaddgroup.group_name_3 = [name3]

    # The role the new users will have
    ckan.userautoaddgroup.group_role = [editor / admin]
    
    # The name of the admin
    ckan.userautoaddgroup.admin_username = [admin user name]

:**Note**: This is at the moment for three categories of grops (based on the data model of SRADI/SDDI catalog). If you have more or less than three top category, you need to change the code at `create.py <ckanext/userautoaddgroup/logic/action/create.py>`_.
